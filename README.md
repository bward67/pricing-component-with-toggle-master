This one was good to do directly after doing the interactive-pricing-component as the toggle is the same.

I re-learnt that you can add and style 2 background-images in css. It is so easy to forget things :O - but the main thing is to know what is possible and then there is no shame in googling it! My tiny brain is getting full to the brim :)!

Users can control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard (by using tab and then the spacebar)
